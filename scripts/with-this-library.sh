# Only the crates the program's Cargo.lock has are patched in, and `cargo update -p` moves them to this checkout
# first: a patch whose version differs from the locked one is otherwise dropped with a warning, and the program
# would build the old release instead (Droidtop/tracker#798). Any "was not used in the crate graph" fails the run.
# A program that does not use lib-plugins at all is skipped with a notice.
